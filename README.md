## Running the Code
### Upload MP4:
If you want to use BlossomNav on a video (.mp4) on your local computer, you can run the following code.
```
cd utils
python split.py video_file_path image_dir 10
cd .. // go back to the parent directory
```
The **video_file_path** is the path to your video, and the **image_dir** is the directory in which you want the images to be saved. 
<br />
### Using the Raspberry Pi Zero 2:
If you have set up the Raspberry Pi Zero 2, you can also use our app to record videos in BlossomNav.
```
python app.py
```
Below is an image of the app's user interface. You can press Start to start recording and stop when you want to by pressing the stop button. After hitting stop, you will get the following pop-up screen. We recommend saving the mp4 into the **data** folder and following the steps from **Upload MP4**.
